abstract = {The use of amniotic membrane (AM) in ophthalmology has been increasing in recent years due to its multiple biological and tectonic properties, improvement in the process of obtaining, ease of use, and advancement in tissue engineering. The AM has become one of the main adjuvant treatments, in ophthalmic surgery as well as in other medical-surgical specialties. The development of tissue engineering has allowed it to be used, not only in its classic form, but also by the use of drops and other presentations. The different steps prior to its use (preparation and conservation), the different surgical techniques, and their main clinical applications are described throughout the article.
Resumen
La utilización de la membrana amniótica (MA) en la oftalmología está en alza en los últimos años debido a sus múltiples propiedades biológicas y tectónicas, la mejora en el proceso de obtención, la facilidad de uso y el avance en la ingeniería tisular. La MA se ha convertido en uno de los principales tratamientos coadyuvantes, tanto en la cirugía oftalmológica como en otras especialidades médico-quirúrgicas. El desarrollo de la ingeniería tisular ha permitido su utilización no solo en su forma clásica sino también mediante gotas y otras presentaciones. A lo largo del articulo hemos realizado un resumen de los distintos pasos previo a su uso (preparación y conservación), las distintas técnicas quirúrgicas y sus principales aplicaciones clínicas.}
